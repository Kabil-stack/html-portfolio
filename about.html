<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm Kabil, currently pursuing my MCA at VHNSN College, Virudhunagar. I have 9 months of work experience as a Traffic Executive in television. 
  I have a strong interest in web development, which is why I’m currently learning HTML. I'm really enjoying the process – it's fun to learn! 
  After HTML, I plan to learn CSS and JavaScript, and later move on to backend development. I'm learning through a Udemy course, and I find it 
  more structured compared to YouTube. I'm really enjoying learning these skills.

  In my free time, I enjoy watching game streams, especially story-based games. My favorite YouTuber is TamilGaming. 
  I've been watching their game streams for the past six years, and it's always fun. I also enjoy watching anime and web series. 
  Occasionally, I read books. Currently, I’m reading *The Silent Patient*, a story about a woman named Alicia. 
  As for my career goals, they’re still evolving — I’m exploring different paths and figuring things out. 
  That’s all about me. Thank you for reading!
